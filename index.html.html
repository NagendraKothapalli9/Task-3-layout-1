        <aside class="left">leftWhen you minimize a window and the footer appears in the middle, it typically indicates a web page's footer is not correctly positioned, often due to short content on the page. To fix this, use CSS to make the footer stay at the bottom of the viewport, either with the Flexbox method (setting the parent to display: flex, flex-direction: column, giving the body a min-height: 100vh, and applying margin-top: auto to the footer) or the Grid method (setting display: grid, grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto on the parent container). </aside>
        <main class="main"> mainhis problem typically happens because there isn't enough content on the page to fill the browser window, and your footer is not configured to stick to the bottom.
